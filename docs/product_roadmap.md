# Product Roadmap & Strategy

> Based on product meeting notes (2025-12-23)

## Strategic Context

**Competitor Analysis:**
- **Cinepoint** (Emtek): Works directly with XXI, strong on daily ticket data.
- **Current Gap**: Production Houses (PH) still manually check data, no analytics layer.

**Target Users:**
- **Production Houses (PH)**: Need data for screen allocation, regional marketing, and ROI analysis.
