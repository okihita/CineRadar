## Common Client Objections & Responses

### "We already have an agency"
> "We're not trying to replace your AOR. We're a specialized partner for technology-driven activations. When you need a robot at an event or AI-generated content, that's us."

### "Can you handle our volume?"
> "Our AI tools multiply capacity. The same team that does 100 assets/month can do 300 with AI assistance. Quality stays high because humans supervise every output."

### "Your portfolio is small"
> "We deliberately focus on breakthrough work over volume. Would you rather see 100 mediocre campaigns or 10 that won awards and drove business results?"

### "How do you handle confidentiality?"
> "Every client is siloed. We sign NDAs. Our AI tools run on private infrastructure—your assets never touch public APIs without explicit permission."

# PART 5: PITCH PREPARATION FOR H2

---

## Different Stakeholder Personalities

### Creative Agency (Rekreasiyuk) Stakeholders

| Type | What They Care About | How to Pitch |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Creative Director** | "Will this cramp my style?" | "AI handles grunt work, you focus on big ideas" |
| **Account Director** | "Will clients approve extra cost?" | "This is included in your retainer optimization" |
| **CFO/Finance** | "What's the ROI?" | "2x output, same headcount = 2x margin" |
| **CEO** | "Will this differentiate us?" | "First AI-native agency in Indonesia" |

---

### Political Client Stakeholders

| Type | What They Care About | How to Pitch |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Candidate** | "Will I win?" | "Our clients outperform polls by 5-10 points" |
| **Campaign manager** | "Is this operational?" | "Dashboard is easy, we train your team" |
| **Finance/treasurer** | "Is this legal?" | "All data is public, no shady practices" |
| **Party leader** | "Power dynamics?" | "Your candidate, your strategy, our tools" |

---

## Handling Political Skepticism

### "Politics is about relationships, not data"
> "Relationships get you in the room. Data wins the room. Your opponent is using data. The question is whether you'll be outgunned."

### "We have internal pollsters"
> "Internal polls tell you where you are. Our platform tells you where you're going—in real-time. We complement your research, not replace it."

### "This sounds like Cambridge Analytica"
> "We use public social media data, not private Facebook harvesting. Everything we do is legal, ethical, and auditable. We'll show you our methodology."

### "What if you're also working for our opponent?"
> "We maintain strict ethical walls. If there's a direct conflict (same province, same race), we choose one client. We'll sign an exclusivity clause."

### "Politicians don't trust tech people"
> "That's why Sepikul is the face. I'm the builder behind the scenes. Your team never needs to talk to engineers—just use the dashboard."

| Concurrent elections | 552 races | "552 races, everyone needs intel" |
| Social media users | 180M+ | "Your electorate is online 4hrs/day" |
| Average campaign spend | Rp30-50B (governor) | "Rp30B budget, are you optimizing?" |
| Hoax spread speed | 6x faster than truth | "Rumors spread 6x faster than corrections" |

---

## The 30-Second Political Pitch

> "Sepikul Political Intelligence gives you three things no traditional pollster offers: real-time sentiment tracking, rumor detection, and an election day war room. While your opponent waits 3 weeks for poll results, you're seeing sentiment shifts by the hour. We've built this for the 552 races in 2027. The question isn't whether you need this—it's whether your opponent gets it first."

---

## Pre-Meeting Checklist (Political)

- [ ] Research the candidate's history and platform
- [ ] Know their party dynamics and coalition
- [ ] Understand their district demographics
- [ ] Prepare 3 insights specific to their race
- [ ] Know their main opponents
- [ ] Identify the decision-maker (often not the candidate)
- [ ] Dress appropriately (formal for government, smart casual for party)
- [ ] Bring physical leave-behind (politicians like paper)
- [ ] Don't record without permission (paranoia is real)

# PART 6: MENTAL PREPARATION

---

## Imposter Syndrome Management

**You will feel like a fraud.** You're a tech person entering politics/media/advertising. Here's the truth:

1. **They need you more than you need them.** Their industry is getting disrupted. You have skills they don't.

2. **Your fresh perspective is an asset.** Insiders are blind to inefficiencies. You see what they miss.

3. **Execution beats credentials.** Nobody cares about your resume after you ship working software.

4. **Iman believes in you.** He's hiring you because he sees the potential. Trust his judgment.

---

## When You Get Attacked

### "You don't understand our industry"
> "You're right—I've only been in this space for [X months]. But I've studied the data obsessively, and I've built tools that senior people find useful. I learn fast."

### "This has been tried before"
> "Previous attempts failed because [lack of data / wrong timing / bad UX]. We've solved those problems. Let me show you how."

### "You're too young/inexperienced"
> "Youth is a feature in tech, not a bug. The tools I use didn't exist 5 years ago. My advantage is that I'm native to AI in ways experienced people aren't."

### "What if this doesn't work?"
> "Then we learn and iterate. Every week, there's a measurable deliverable. If something's not working, we catch it early. We're not betting the company on one big launch."

---

## Daily Affirmations (Seriously)

Read these before every pitch meeting:

1. "I have built something real. The proof is on the screen."
2. "I am here to solve their problem, not to impress them."
3. "Their skepticism is healthy. I would be skeptical too."
4. "Every question is a gift—it tells me what they care about."
5. "The worst case is I learn something. The best case is partnership."

---

## Emergency Phrases

When you're stuck in a meeting, use these:

| Situation | Phrase |
|-----------|--------|
| Don't know the answer | "That's a great question. Let me find the precise answer and follow up after this meeting." |
| Need to redirect | "Before we go deeper into that, can I show you something related?" |
| Hostile audience | "I can see this raises concerns. What would help you feel more comfortable?" |
| Running out of time | "I want to respect your time. Could we schedule a follow-up to go deeper?" |
| They want a discount | "I understand budget is a factor. Could you help me understand your constraints so we can find a creative solution?" |

---

**You've got this. Now go build the empire.**
