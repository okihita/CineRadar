## Movie Distributors & Studios

### Hollywood Studios in Indonesia
| Studio | Local Office | Key Contact Level |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Disney** | PT Walt Disney Indonesia | Country Manager |
| **Warner Bros** | Local distributor (outsourced) | Regional |
| **Universal** | Local distributor | Regional |
| **Paramount** | PT Satrya Perkasa Esthetika | Local |
| **Sony** | Local distributor | Regional |

---

| Studio | Notable Films | Owner/Key Figure |

| **Starvision** | Distribution + production | Chand Parwez |

## Common Objections & Responses

### "Our data is proprietary"
> "We're not asking for your data. We're showing you market data that helps you compete. XXI doesn't share their data with CGV either—but both would benefit from knowing when Marvel releases affect local films."

### "We already have a tech team"
> "Your tech team builds ticketing systems. We build intelligence systems. They're complementary. Would your team rather build a demand prediction model or focus on the POS system?"

### "How do we know your data is accurate?"
> "We can backtest. Give us any 10 showtimes from last month—we'll show you how our predictions would have performed. Zero cost, zero commitment."

### "This sounds expensive"
> "Our pricing is based on value delivered. If our predictions help you fill 5% more seats, the ROI is 10x-20x. We can start with a small pilot to prove it."

---

# PART 2: OUT-OF-HOME (OOH) ADVERTISING

---

## Market Overview

| Metric | 2023-2024 Data |
|--------|----------------|
| Total OOH Market | Rp7-8 trillion ($450M) |
| Digital OOH (DOOH) | ~15% of total (growing 25%/year) |
| Key Cities | Jakarta (60%), Surabaya (10%), Bandung (8%) |

**Trend:** OOH is going programmatic. Instead of buying a billboard for 1 month, advertisers want to buy impressions in real-time.

---

## Key Players

### OOH Networks
| Company | Focus | Size |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Stickearn** | DOOH network, cars, retail | 5,000+ screens |
| **EYE Indonesia** | Premium billboards | Legacy player |
| **MNC Outdoor** | TV group's OOH arm | Diverse inventory |
| **Moving Walls** | Malaysian programmatic DOOH | Tech-first |
| **PT Asa Suryaraya** | Traditional billboards | Old-school |

### Programmatic Platforms
| Platform | Parent | Indonesia Status |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Vistar Media** | Global | Entering market |
| **Hivestack** | Perion | Limited presence |
| **VIOOH** | JCDecaux | Airport focus |

---

## How DOOH Buying Works

**Traditional (Old Way):**
```
Brand → Media Agency → OOH Network → Billboard
     (2-week process, fixed price)
```

**Programmatic (New Way):**
```
Brand → DSP (DV360/TTD) → SSP (us!) → Real-time auction → Billboard
     (milliseconds, dynamic price)
```

**CineRadar's Role:** We become the SSP (Supply-Side Platform) that makes cinema billboards available to programmatic buyers.

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### "Cinema billboards aren't premium enough"
> "A mall billboard gets 10,000 impressions/day with mixed attention. A cinema billboard gets 3,000 impressions from people about to spend 2 hours with zero distractions. Quality over quantity."

### "We already have OOH partners"
> "Your partners sell static impressions. We sell intelligent impressions—dynamically priced based on real-time cinema occupancy. Same billboard, 30% higher yield."

### "Programmatic OOH is too complicated"
> "That's exactly why we built a simple integration. One API connection, and your inventory is available to DV360, The Trade Desk, and every global DSP."

# PART 3: MOVIE STUDIO INTELLIGENCE

---

## The Studio Problem

**Studios fly blind.** When Disney releases "Moana 2" in Indonesia:
- They don't know which cities to focus marketing
- They don't know optimal release weekends
- They can't track competitor performance in real-time
- Post-release data comes 3 weeks late

**CineRadar solves this.**

---

## Studio Decision Cycles

| Phase | Key Questions | CineRadar Helps? |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **Greenlight** | Will this movie work in Indonesia? | ✅ Market analysis |
| **Dating** | When should we release? | ✅ Timing optimizer |
| **Marketing** | Where should we spend? | ✅ City-level demand |
| **Opening** | How are we doing hour-by-hour? | ✅ Real-time tracker |
| **Holdover** | Add screens or reduce? | ✅ Screen optimization |

---

## Industry Calendar

| Period | What Happens | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Jan-Feb** | Oscar season, slow domestic | Pitch for year-ahead planning |
| **Mar-Apr** | Lebaran season (biggest) | Real-time monitoring critical |
| **Jun-Aug** | Summer tentpoles, school holiday | Hollywood studios active |
| **Nov-Dec** | Year-end blockbusters | Holiday movie rush |

**Key Insight:** Pitch studios in Q1 when they're planning the year. By Q2, budgets are locked.

---

# PART 4: PITCH PREPARATION

---

## Mental Framework

**You are not selling software. You are selling:**
1. **Competitive advantage** — "Know what others don't"
2. **Risk reduction** — "Avoid costly mistakes"
3. **Revenue maximization** — "Fill more seats, sell more popcorn"

---

## Handling Skepticism

### "You're just a tech guy"
> "I'm a tech guy who spent a week building the most comprehensive cinema intelligence platform in Indonesia. This dashboard you're looking at? That's one week. Imagine 52 weeks."

### "We've seen pitches like this before"
> "I'm not pitching a PowerPoint. I'm showing you a working product. Here's live data from your theatres. Here's a prediction for next weekend. Test me."

### "Why should we trust an outsider?"
> "You shouldn't trust me—yet. That's why I'm proposing a 3-month pilot. No long-term commitment. Measurable outcomes. If I don't deliver value, you pay nothing."

### "This sounds like a lot of work to integrate"
> "Week 1: API access. Week 2: Dashboard live. Week 3: First insights. I've designed this to be self-serve. Your team doesn't need to do anything."

---

## Body Language & Delivery

| Do | Don't |
|----|----|
| Speak slowly, pause for effect | Rush through slides |
| Make eye contact with decision-maker | Stare at your laptop |
| Ask questions: "Does this resonate?" | Monologue for 30 minutes |
| Use "you" language: "Your revenue..." | Use "I" language: "I built..." |
| Acknowledge objections: "That's a fair point" | Get defensive |

---

## Questions to Ask THEM

1. "What's your biggest challenge with data right now?"
2. "How do you currently measure theatre/movie performance?"
3. "If you could know one thing you don't know today, what would it be?"
4. "Who else should be in this conversation?"
5. "What would success look like for a pilot?"

---

## Key Numbers to Memorize

| Stat | Number | Use In Pitch |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Indonesia cinema market | Rp2.5T/year | "This is a Rp2.5 trillion market flying blind" |
| Empty seats daily | 40% average | "40% of inventory goes unsold every day" |
| OOH market size | Rp7T/year | "Rp7 trillion OOH market going programmatic" |
| Local film growth | +45% in 2024 | "Local content is exploding—studios need intel" |
| CineRadar data points | 83,000+ showtimes | "We've analyzed 83,000 showtimes already" |

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> "CineRadar is the Bloomberg Terminal for Indonesian cinema. We provide real-time intelligence on movie performance, theatre occupancy, and advertising opportunity—data that doesn't exist anywhere else. We're already tracking 600+ theatres and 80,000+ showtimes. Studios use us to time releases. Advertisers use us to buy smarter. Theatres use us to fill more seats. This is the infrastructure layer for a Rp2.5 trillion industry."
