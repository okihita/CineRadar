# 🎯 2026 Value Creation Roadmap for Iman Sjafei
## From CineRadar to Political-Media-Creative Empire

---

## The Big Picture

**You have four powerful entities. They operate separately. I will connect them into one data-driven machine.**

```
         SEPIKUL (Political Advisory)
              ↑ insights ↑
    TOTAL POLITIK ←→ CINERADAR ←→ REKREASIYUK
    (Media Reach)    (AdTech)     (Creative Execution)
              ↓ distribution ↓
         JOINT INDONESIA (Client Delivery)
```

**My Role:** Build the pipes that make data, insights, and automation flow between all four.

# H1 2026: CineRadar Becomes the AdTech Backbone

---

## 🗓️ JANUARY: The Data Foundation

### The Market Reality
Indonesia's cinema industry generates **Rp15+ trillion/year**, but operates on gut feeling. Movie studios guess which weekends to release. Advertisers buy billboard space without knowing if anyone's watching. Theatre chains set ticket prices based on tradition, not demand.

**CineRadar already has the data. In January, we turn it into products.**

---

### Week 1: Real-Time Occupancy Feed

**Why It's Needed:**
Right now, advertisers buying cinema pre-roll ads pay the same CPM whether the theatre is 90% full or 30% full. That's insane. A packed Friday night premiere is worth 5x more than a Tuesday afternoon matinee.

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They Need This |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Dentsu Indonesia** | Largest media buyer, spends Rp200B+/year on OOH/cinema |
| **GroupM (Mindshare/MediaCom)** | Manages P&G, Unilever, Nestlé cinema buys |
| **Stickearn** | DOOH network needs real-time data for pricing |

**Value:** Rp150M/quarter ($9,375) from API licensing

---

### Week 2: Movie Demand Predictor

**Why It's Needed:**
When a studio releases a movie, they're gambling. "Agak Laen" was expected to be a small comedy—it became the highest-grossing Indonesian film ever. Studios need to know which movies will pop BEFORE opening weekend.

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They Care |
|---------|--------------|
| **Falcon Pictures** | Produced "Agak Laen", wants to replicate success |
| **Starvision** | Major distributor, needs to allocate marketing budget |
| **Screenplay Films** | Growing studio, needs data to compete with majors |

**The Pitch:** "We predicted 'Vina: Sebelum 7 Hari' would outperform 3 weeks before release. You could have secured 20% more screens."

**Value:** Rp150M/month ($9,375) in prediction subscriptions

---

### Week 3: Theatre Performance Score

**Why It's Needed:**
XXI has 234 theatres. CGV has 72. Cinepolis has 40+. But nobody knows which specific theatres are actually printing money vs. bleeding cash. A theatre in Pondok Indah Mall is obviously different from one in a Bekasi suburb—but by how much?

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They Care |
|---------|--------------|
| **Cinema XXI (PT Nusantara Sejahtera Raya)** | Optimize their massive network |
| **CGV Indonesia** | Korean HQ demands data-driven decisions |
| **Mall operators (Lippo, Pakuwon, Sinar Mas Land)** | Negotiate cinema rents based on performance |

**Value:** Rp100M/quarter ($6,250) in analytics packages

---

### Week 4: Developer Platform

**Why It's Needed:**
Indonesia's app ecosystem is exploding. Traveloka, Tiket.com, GoTo—they all sell movie tickets. But they're flying blind. They don't know which movies are trending, which showtimes to highlight, or where to promote.

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They Care |
|---------|--------------|
| **Traveloka** | Sells 15M+ movie tickets/year, wants better curation |
| **Tiket.com** | Competes with Traveloka, needs edge |
| **TIX ID** | Official XXI app, ironically has worse data than us |
| **GoTo (Tokopedia)** | Exploring entertainment vertical |

**Value:** Rp150M/month ($9,375) from SDK licensing

---

### **January Narrative Summary:**
> "In January, we transform CineRadar from a dashboard into a platform. We create the API that media agencies, studios, and ticketing apps will depend on. This isn't a feature—it's infrastructure that generates recurring revenue."

**January Total: Rp550M ($34,375)**

---

## 🗓️ FEBRUARY: Conquering Out-of-Home Advertising

### The Market Reality
Indonesia's Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising is a **Rp7 trillion/year** market, and it's going programmatic. Instead of buying a billboard for 1 month, advertisers want to buy impressions in real-time, like digital ads.

**Cinema billboards are premium inventory.** 100% of people walking past them are about to spend 2 hours with full attention. But there's no data. CineRadar changes that.

---

### Week 5: Billboard Inventory Database

**Why It's Needed:**
Ask any media planner: "How many cinema billboards exist in Indonesia?" Nobody knows. We'll build the first comprehensive database—location, size, estimated impressions, current pricing.

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They'd Pay |
|---------|---------------|
| **Stickearn** | Largest DOOH network, needs inventory mapping |
| **Moving Walls** | Malaysian DOOH platform entering Indonesia |
| **VIOOH Indonesia** | JCDecaux's programmatic arm |
| **Adskom** | Local programmatic OOH player |

**Value:** Rp250M ($15,625) one-time database license

---

### Week 6: Dynamic Pricing for Billboards

**Why It's Needed:**
A billboard at 7 PM on Avengers opening night is worth 10x more than the same billboard on Tuesday afternoon. But currently, both cost the same. We fix this.

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They Care |
|---------|--------------|
| **Unilever Indonesia** | Spends Rp500B+/year on advertising |
| **Coca-Cola Amatil** | Heavy cinema advertiser (popcorn + Coke) |
| **Samsung Indonesia** | Launches phones at cinemas constantly |
| **Telkomsel** | Always buying youth-targeted placements |

**The Pitch:** "Pay 50% less for off-peak, 100% more for premium moments. Same budget, 40% more effective impressions."

**Value:** Rp100M/month ($6,250) in platform fees

---

### Week 7: Programmatic OOH Connector

**Why It's Needed:**
Global brands want to buy Indonesian media through platforms like The Trade Desk and DV360. But local OOH inventory isn't connected. We become the bridge.

**Target Customers:**
| Company | Why They Need Us |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Google DV360** | Needs Indonesian OOH supply |
| **The Trade Desk** | Pushing into SEA programmatic |
| **Xandr (Microsoft)** | Building OOH marketplace |

**Value:** Rp100M/month ($6,250) in connector fees

---

### Week 8: Partnership Deals

**Why It Matters:**
We approach DOOH networks with a simple deal: "Use our data, we take 30% of the premium you charge."

**Target Partners:**
| Partner | Our Value to Them |
|---------|------------------|
| **Stickearn** | We make their cinema placements 2x more valuable |
| **EYE Indonesia** | Struggling to differentiate, our data is unique |
| **MNC Media** | Has billboards near cinemas, needs occupancy intel |

**Value:** Rp90M/month ($5,625) in revenue share

---

### **February Narrative Summary:**
> "In February, we insert CineRadar into the Rp7 trillion OOH advertising market. Every cinema billboard in Indonesia becomes smarter—and we take a cut of every premium impression sold. This is infrastructure revenue that compounds."

**February Total: Rp540M ($33,750)**

---

## 🗓️ MARCH: Movie Studios Become Customers

### The Market Reality
Indonesian film production is booming. 2024 saw 180+ local releases, up from 130 in 2022. But Hollywood studios and local production houses are competing blind. They release movies based on "feel", not data.

**Studios will pay handsomely to know what we know.**

---

### Week 9: Studio Analytics Portal

**Why It's Needed:**
When Disney releases "Moana 2" in Indonesia, they have no local intelligence. They rely on 3-month-old research reports. We give them real-time competitor tracking, showtime optimization, and audience insights.

**Target Customers:**
| Studio | Why They Need Us |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Walt Disney Indonesia** | Releases 8-10 films/year, Rp500B+ box office |
| **Warner Bros Indonesia** | "Joker 2", "Dune", need local intel |
| **Universal Pictures** | Competing for screen time |
| **Paramount** | "Mission Impossible", etc. |

**Local Studios:**
| Studio | Why They Need Us |
|--------|-----------------|
| **MD Entertainment** | Biggest local producer (120+ films) |
| **Falcon Pictures** | "Agak Laen" success, want to replicate |
| **Screenplay Films** | "Vina", "KKN", riding horror wave |
| **Visinema** | "Mencuri Raden Saleh", prestige films |

**Value:** Rp225M/month ($14,063) from 3 studio subscriptions

---

### Week 10: Release Date Optimizer

**Why It's Needed:**
Releasing a rom-com on the same weekend as a Marvel movie is suicide. But studios often don't know competitor release dates until too late. We create the definitive release calendar with "green zones" and "red zones."

**The Pitch to Falcon Pictures:**
> "If you had released 'Agak Laen' one week earlier, you would have avoided competition with 'Kung Fu Panda 4'. Based on our model, that's Rp15B in additional box office."

**Value:** Rp100M ($6,250) per strategic recommendation

---

### Week 11: Competitive Intelligence

**Why It's Needed:**
When "Vina" became a viral phenomenon, its competitors had no warning. They watched helplessly as it consumed all available screens. With CineRadar, rivals would have seen the surge 3 days earlier and adjusted marketing.

**The Pitch:**
> "We detected 'Siksa Neraka' underperforming by Day 2. You could have pulled marketing spend and saved Rp2B."

**Value:** Rp75M/month ($4,688) as premium add-on

---

### Week 12: Enterprise Sales Blitz

**Why It Matters:**
March is when we close annual contracts. Studios plan their 2026-2027 release calendars in Q1. We need to be in those meetings.

**Target Meetings:**
- **Disney** → Rp900M/year contract
- **Warner** → Rp600M/year contract
- **Falcon** → Rp300M/year contract
- **Screenplay** → Rp200M/year contract

**Value:** Rp150M/month ($9,375) from signed contracts

---

### **March Narrative Summary:**
> "In March, CineRadar becomes the Bloomberg Terminal of Indonesian cinema. Studios in both Hollywood and Jakarta pay us monthly retainers to see what's really happening in the market. We become essential infrastructure for film release strategy."

**March Total: Rp550M ($34,375)**

---

## 🗓️ APRIL: Building the Ad Exchange

### The Market Reality
Cinema advertising in Indonesia is a **Rp1.5 trillion/year** market, but it's bought like it's 1995. Brands negotiate directly with XXI, send a PowerPoint, and wait 2 weeks. Meanwhile, digital ads are bought in milliseconds.

**We bring programmatic efficiency to cinema ads.**

---

### Week 13-14: Self-Serve Ad Platform

**Why It's Needed:**
Small and medium businesses can't advertise in cinemas because the minimum buy is too high and the process is too complex. A bubble tea shop near a cinema should be able to buy 100 impressions to the next 3 showtimes. We make that possible.

**Target Customers:**
| Segment | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **F&B near cinemas** | Chatime, Kopi Kenangan, Fore Coffee |
| **Retail** | Miniso, Cotton On, IKEA (Jakarta Garden City) |
| **Mobile games** | Garena, Moonton (Mobile Legends) |
| **App installs** | Shopee, Tokopedia, Grab |

**Value:** Rp40M/month ($2,500) in platform revenue

---

### Week 15-16: Connecting to Global Demand

**Why It's Needed:**
When P&G or Samsung buys media in Indonesia through DV360, they can't buy cinema. That's Rp100B+/year in demand we're not capturing. We connect CineRadar to global DSPs.

**Target Integrations:**
| Platform | Why They Want Us |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Google DV360** | Needs Indonesian cinema supply |
| **The Trade Desk** | Aggressive SEA expansion |
| **Amazon DSP** | Entering Indonesian market |

**Value:** Rp130M/month ($8,125) in programmatic fill

---

### **April Narrative Summary:**
> "In April, we democratize cinema advertising. Any business, from a ramen shop to Samsung, can buy cinema impressions in seconds. We become the Google Ads of physical entertainment spaces."

**April Total: Rp170M ($10,625)**

---

## 🗓️ MAY: Theatre Revenue Optimization

### The Market Reality
Indonesian cinemas leave **30-40% of seats empty** on average. That's Rp3 trillion/year in unsold inventory. Meanwhile, premium showtimes sell out while off-peak showtimes are ghost towns.

**We fix the demand curve.**

---

### Week 17-18: Dynamic Ticket Pricing

**Why It's Needed:**
Airlines do this. Hotels do this. Uber does this. But cinemas still charge Rp50,000 whether it's a Tuesday 2 PM showing or an Avengers Saturday premiere. We introduce demand-based pricing.

**Target Customers:**
| Chain | Why They Need This |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Cinema XXI** | 234 theatres, Rp10T+ annual ticket revenue |
| **CGV Indonesia** | Korean HQ built dynamic pricing in Korea |
| **Cinepolis** | Mexican parent uses dynamic pricing globally |

**The Pitch to XXI:**
> "In a 50-theatre pilot, dynamic pricing increased revenue 12% with zero additional cost. That's Rp120B/year if deployed nationally."

**Value:** Rp125M/month ($7,813) in SaaS fees + revenue share

---

### Week 19-20: Flash Sale Automation

**Why It's Needed:**
When a showtime is at 30% capacity 2 hours before show, that's a crisis. Currently, theatres do nothing. We auto-trigger 20-40% discounts and push notifications to fill seats.

**Target Customers:**
Same theatre chains, plus:
| Partner | Why They Care |
|---------|--------------|
| **TIX ID** | Official XXI app, wants engagement features |
| **Traveloka** | Loves flash sales, drives repeat usage |
| **Shopee** | ShopeePay movie tickets, wants promotions |

**Value:** Rp100M/month ($6,250) in recovered revenue share

---

### **May Narrative Summary:**
> "In May, we become the revenue management brain of Indonesian cinemas. Every ticket is optimally priced. Every empty seat is a sales opportunity. Theatres make more money, we take a percentage."

**May Total: Rp225M ($14,063)**

---

## 🗓️ JUNE: Event Tech (Bridge to H2)

### The Market Reality
Movie premieres are marketing events worth Rp500M-2B each. Studios fly in stars, hire influencers, build red carpets. But they measure success by "vibes" not data.

**We bring data to experiential marketing—and cross-sell to Rekreasiyuk.**

---

### Week 21-24: Premiere Intelligence Suite

**Why It's Needed:**
When Disney premieres "Moana 2" at Plaza Senayan, they invite 200 influencers. But which ones actually posted? What was the reach? Was sentiment positive? Currently, a junior staffer manually counts Instagram stories. We automate everything.

**Target Customers:**
| Client | Why They Need This |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Disney Indonesia** | 8-10 premieres/year, Rp400M+ each |
| **Warner Bros** | Major tent-poles need measurement |
| **Netflix Indonesia** | "Cigarette Girl" premiere was massive |
| **Vidio** | Streaming premieres, needs data |

**The Cross-Sell:**
> "This product was built for movie premieres. But it works for ANY event. Let's have coffee with the Rekreasiyuk team."

**Value:** Rp500M/month ($31,250) in event packages

---

### **June Narrative Summary:**
> "In June, we complete the CineRadar product suite AND create the bridge to Rekreasiyuk. The same technology that tracks movie premieres can track brand launches, product unveilings, and political rallies. We've built the connective tissue for H2."

**June Total: Rp500M ($31,250)**

---

## 🎤 The Closing Narrative

> "Pak Iman, you have built four powerful entities. Total Politik reaches millions. Sepikul advises the elite. Rekreasiyuk creates world-class experiences. Joint Indonesia executes with precision.
>
> But they operate as silos.
>
> In 2026, I will wire them together with data and AI. Starting with CineRadar—turning a dashboard into a Rp2.5B/year AdTech business in 6 months. Then expanding that playbook to your entire portfolio.
>
> By December, CGV will pay us for pricing intelligence. Disney will subscribe to our release optimizer. Dentsu will buy programmatic cinema through our exchange. And when the 2027 gubernatorial campaigns begin, we'll have the most sophisticated political intelligence operation in the country.
>
> All for Rp100M/month—one-third the cost of a traditional IT department.
>
> This isn't a job application. It's a partnership proposal."
